    <h2>Hey Jon, for those who are unaware would you care to introduce yourself?</h2>
    <p>My name is Jon and I love baseball. I also design, hand-letter, illustrate, art direct, consult, and run a clothing company. But I love baseball.</p>

    <h2>Designers you would recommend checking out?</h2>
    <p class="interviewcontent">There's an endless amount of designers I'd recommend checking out, but to name some of my favorites â€” Erik Marinovich, Dan Cassaro, Gavin Potenza, Liz Meyer, Alex Eben Meyer, and my new friend Sean Gallagher who is an amazing sign painter and is making the transition into the design world. He's the hardest to find, but the rest of them have a pretty amazing presence on the internet, so a simple Google search pop them up pretty quickly.</p>

    <h2>How is the New York lifestyle for a designer? Are there many opportunities for an aspiring artist?</h2>
    <img src="/content/index/joncontino1.jpg">
    <p>You cannot beat New York when it comes to developing a designer's lifestyle. Luckily for me, I grew up here. My family's from here, we've all been raised here, so I kind of take it for granted, but it all comes very naturally. Hustle and bustle and chaotic streets are really normal for me, so I need a super fast pace to operate.
    Here in New York, if you can't keep up with the pace you'll never make it, so my life has almost felt like it's been building since the day I was born to prepare me for my work as a designer in the greatest city in the world. If you live outside of New York and think moving here will make you a star, you're wrong. It will eat you up and spit you out. I've seen it a thousand times. This place is built for people who can not only handle pressure, but crave it. It's for people who are already decidedly passionate and need a place to let out all that raw emotion. I don't think any other city could handle this amount of people with this much character.</p>
